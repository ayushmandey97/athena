Wadsworth Ave Philadelphia, Pa. Reds Creative Kutz has been a staple in the community for more than 2 decades.

Classic Jazz Lullabies: Volume 1 debuts this week and was developed by multi-talented Mom, Tiffany Graves-Davis and Grammy award-winning Producer, Phil Davis. The CD features traditional songs like \u201cNow I Lay Me Down To Sleep,\u201d \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star,\u201d and \u201cSomewhere Over The Rainbow,\u201d but while the words are familiar the upbeat tunes and rhythmic beats will forever change the melodies that have lived in our heads for generations.Classic Jazz Lullabies: Volume 1 is a musical journey like none you have ever experienced. The concept behind Classic Jazz Lullabies is to introduce to the world a traditional lullaby with a jazz interpretation. The unique nature of jazz lends itself to a myriad of voices, colors and sounds. Applying the jazz tradition to lullabies allows the listener to blend the aforementioned elements to \u201cpaint their own pictures\u201d while nurturing a spirit of comfort and relaxation. \u201cI see this as something parents can incorporate into their bedtime routine or use it themselves as a relaxation tool while reminiscing about their childhood,\u201d says Tiffany.\u201cMy kids love it,\u201d Tiffany says. \u201cWe incorporated their voices in one of the tracks \u2018Man in the Moon.\u2019 Joanna, the youngest, sings along on most of the songs at bedtime.\u201dStudies show and psychologists agree there is a strong link between music and early cognitive development. Music can also build language skills and provide a solid foundation for early learning. Tiffany has surrounded her children with music since they were in the womb. Classic Jazz Lullabies: Volume 1 is this duos way of sharing a creative learning tool with other parents. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to expose my children to activities that allow them to grow and flourish. Music has facilitated that exposure.\u201d"

But when my grandmother made her pepper sauce at my parent\u2019s house, I knew I had tasted something very different. I experienced some heat but a ton of flavor to accompany it. It elevated the taste of my food instead of drowning it in hot peppers and vinegar. I instantly started sharing it and I saw the same joy in other\u2019s faces. So Grandma taught me how to make it and I practiced until I had it right on my own. The one thing she said was \u201cmake sure they know it\u2019s Trini!,\u201d and so I did. Did you know the image on the label is actually a rendering of her hands? Not to mention, whenever I saw pepper sauce in the grocery store they were only sauces from Jamaica, not Trinidad and our flavors are very different. So I decided to sell my own. Our goal is to bring you flavor and joy while introducing you to the wonderful islands of Trinidad & Tobago. Take a look around, get to know us, and give us a try. You won\u2019t regret it, promise."

After many attempts in looking for a mainstream product failed, He fervently began researching natural ingredients for facial hair care and growth. It occurred to him that he could make my own beard oil based off my research by infusing essential oils, and herbs that were already growing in his garden.The goal was to be 100% organic and natural. He formulated many batches to try on himself and after trial and error, He finally found a recipe that showed significant improvement in the health and growth of his beard used my product for 3 months before making samples for fellow beards to try.The feedback was overwhelmingly positive as my samples yielded fantastic results! It was at that moment he decided to create my own beard care line and soon after Five O\u2019Clock Co. was born!"

I specialize in social and community events and strive to make your dream event come true. I chose to work in events because I love to help create joy and bring people together. There is nothing quite like creating a space where people can gather and enjoy each other\u2019s company over a common goal.With a B.S. in Entertainment Management and over 6 years of venue and event management experience with companies including Universal Music Group, The House of Blues, and the famous Dolby Theater (home of The Academy Awards), I decided to start working for myself.I spent my years working on the venue side of event production, witnessing countless events that were mismanaged, causing stress for all parties involved, thus learning quickly how things should NOT be done. Having an understanding of how events work from the production and venue perspective, I decided to take my expertise to you, the client.I believe in providing such excellent services that you should never have to worry about a single thing on your event day. Does the venue need forms? Can\u2019t keep track of who needs to be paid when? DJ is nowhere to be found? Did the photographer cancel the last minute? You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that, leave it me to handle all the logistics, be the middle-woman between you and your vendors so that you can focus on your day."

Informed by a doctor that he would likely be at risk for coronary artery disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure later in life if he did not change his ways, Dino decided to do something about it by exercising and eating right.

My family members and I looked into did some research and scoured the web for insights and reviews of this compound, and after many months of looking into the subject, we came to a conclusion that this is a product we need to provide and educate people on as much as possible.Since then we have attended many festivals, seminars and spoken to multiple doctors about the positive effect of CBD. Our research has taken us all over the world, most notably in the US, Canada and the UK with the intention to find the best quality CBD at competitive pricing.We are a small family-run business and are grateful to all our customers for helping put a roof over our heads.Customer satisfaction is our #1 priority."

So these are simple messages brought to us via His Spirit. Many years ago, these were simple affirmations that came to the brand\u2019s owner as she prayed. With her graphic design gift, she discovered cool ways to bring these affirmations to light and to print.\u201cGod\u2019s divine power has given us everything we need for life and for godliness. This power was given to us through knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and integrity.\u201d\u2014 II PETER 1:3PhilosophyBrought to You by One Believer (aka B2Yb1B) is an urban Christian brand that boldly expresses the simplicity of our Faith. Each design is based on scripture that assists us as we maneuver through our daily lives.The brand\u2019s designs are unique. They are not meant to be perfect or \u201ccrisp\u201d as other designs are presented. With subtle hints of imperfection, the designs are meant to bring clarity. We are being perfected on this life\u2019s journey. Life is forever transitioning. With our marching orders \u201cwalk by faith and not by sight\u201d, each design is created. This makes life so much more fun\u2026just seeing His perfection in the imperfect person, situation, or these designs.And finally, this brand is owned by daC7 Enterprises LLC."

        "Description": "Angela Wells began her wellness journey in 2013 when she first became vegan, stopped relaxing her hair, wearing weaves, and began the journey of loc\u2019ing her hair. She also worked as an organic oil consultant for d\u014dTERRA (which mean from the Earth), learning how to replace pharmaceutical drugs with pure essential oils. In 2014, Angela\u2019s hair began to break and fall out, causing her to shave 1 side of her head and start over. As she rocked what was called (at the time) the \u201cRihanna cut\u201d as a fashion statement for a year and a half, she then combined her research of natural oils & butters and knowledge of essential oils to create Hair Gold, a scalp treatment to ensure follicles are sprouting healthy strong hair at the roots. When the scalp is properly conditioned and balanced, free from dandruff, inflammation, thinning, shedding, and other hair issues, hair will truly flourish in ways you never thought possible! Once Hair Gold worked to regrow her hair healthy and strong, she launched Serein Naturals in January 2016 with the help of her sister and cousins. From there, more and more products became a part of the Serein Naturals collection.Serein Naturals is founded on a passion for using chemical-free, vegan and plant-based ingredients nature blessed us all with to enhance the health of your hair & skin.  All Serein Naturals products are handmade with LOVE, using mostly organic ingredients, and scented using pure essential oils (fragrance oils do more harm than good and are never used).Serein {Se-r\u0101in} means fine rain falling after sunset in which no clouds are visible. The name derives from the French word Serein, meaning \u201cserene,\u201d which is commonly known as calm, peaceful, and tranquil. Serein Naturals wants you to embrace your temple in all its natural glory and bring peace to every cell of your skin & scalp. Angela is available for seminars & speaking engagements on topics of health & wellness, the benefits of using chemical-free products, essential oils, and self-love.Like Us on Instagram!Ask a Question"

In traditional Chinese medicine, each of these effects is considered essential to treating disease and achieving health. In addition, ear acupuncture is sometimes used to enhance mood, aid in smoking cessation, alleviate pain, promote sounder sleep, relieve stress, and support weight loss.

However, we soon began catering to the needs of men and women of all sizes who appreciate style and understand the value of quality.To better serve our clients, ready-made collections of classic footwear were developed and wholesaled to some of the most exclusive boutiques and department stores worldwide. And recently, we further expanded our offerings with the introduction of our luxury trainer collections.While we have historically operated a traditional wholesale-to-retailer business, we are currently transitioning into a direct-to-consumer model. Using technology based platforms, we will be able to provide the same great products, featuring all the characteristics that define luxury (quality, styling and exclusivity), except the exorbitant pricing.Our offerings will be more focused and curated based on consumer input. This enables us to streamline production, cut out the middlemen and ultimately provide you, our consumer, more valued pricing.Whether bespoke or ready-made, all of our products reflect cordwainer Ron Donovan\u2019s eclectic sensibilities, his attention to detail, his commitment to craftsmanship and adhere to his personal design philosophy, \u201cclassic with a modernistic edge\u201d. The results are products that move easily from the boardroom to a night out on the town and beyond.Our commitment is to continually provide the \u201cRONDONOVAN Difference\u201d, a unique combination of design, craftsmanship, value, experience and service."

During his college years he was deemed the nickname of \u201cDr. FlyGuy\u201d by friends and associates, due to his individual style and professional attire. Dr. Jones experimented within the styles of fashion and found his signature, with wearing bow ties. Bow ties are subtle and unique in size, but can accent and speak volumes for the character and overall distinction of an outfit.The human-animal bond is a mutually beneficial and dynamic relationship between people and animals that positively influences the health and well-being of both. Our Bow Ties create an environment where this bond between man & animals is nurtured. When an individual fashions their pet with one of our signature bow ties, it truly bridges the family gap between two different species.As we move forward with our vision, the \u201cDr. FlyGuy Collection\u201d seeks to assist others with building character, promote self-expression, and generate self-love."

Our products are engineered specifically to address the unique skincare issues faced by men today. Each product has been created with unique nourishing blends of plant extracts and other natural skin care ingredients.We are dedicated to providing men with an easy and efficient facial care regimen for everyday use. Our products have been tested and prescribed by plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and other skin care specialists worldwide. Efficacy and quality are valuable keys to our success.Active ingredients in J. Arthur are not only of the highest quality, but are concentrated in the purest form. Unlike other products, J. Arthur will give immediate response and gratification. You will no longer have to wait several weeks with continual usage to see results.Our goal was to create a product that would work for Men of various ethnicities and skin types. We wanted a skin care regime that would leave a man\u2019s face feeling clean moisturized and most importantly it needed to work fast. We wanted something that was premium quality, made from the best ingredients and was clinical strength. We partnered with a US based manufacturer that took our ingredients, basic formulas and notes to create a number of viable solutions which we tested to see if it lived up to our mission and idea. After multiple rounds of testing and tweaking we found our patented solution.

In April I was laid off from my job and forced to truly think about my future in a way I hadn\u2019t really done, so I started doing the research on business ownership and started to dig deep into what I was really passionate about which was Hair Care, with the support of my amazing wife we dove head first into this journey and we are proud to say we opened the doors to our store The Hair Store LLC, on June 9th 2017 and have been growing ever since thanks to the amazing support of the community, we\u2019ve been able to do so many amazing things and we are going to continue to follow this amazing path and we hope you join us."

        "Description": "Cedric Brown, 26, is a fashion designer and visual artist. In his hometown of Atlanta, GA, he runs a family-owned apparel business. Raised by a single mother, her phenomenal style was his inspiration for his fashion sketches. Instead of getting caught up in the self-destructive cycle of a fatherless home, he chose to express himself through his art. Through his hard work and perseverance, he received national scholarships and grants to pay his way through college. He received a B.F.A in Fashion Design from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) and took business courses at the Operation Hope center.Cedric has made a lifetime dedication to the arts. In 2010, his painting \u201cAs the Twig Bends, so the Tree Inclines\u201d was selected for permanent display in the National Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. In addition, he gained professional work experience through design internships and freelance work in New York City and Hong Kong, as well as interning at big corporations such as Sears/K-Mart, Li and Fung Limited, and Carter\u2019s.While attending SCAD, his fashion professors advised him to incorporate his painting background into his apparel designs. After receiving business advice from designer Wes Gordon, he learned that being known for one special item can open doors to the development of his fashion business. Later, he decided to launch his line of accessories. Featuring his original artwork, each accessory tells a story. Celebrities such as Angie Stone and Wyclef Jean have been seen wearing his pieces.Being a featured designer on CNN, State Farm, Jezebel, Sheen, and TUC magazines, he\u2019s on his way to becoming a leading American fashion brand."

My journey started in 2014 when my mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. In the end of 2015 when my mom was all done with her treatment I wanted to help other families who went through the same journey that my family had to go through. When I went to the doctors office to get my flu shot, I asked my mom if she ever went to go get a breast cancer screening. She replied no, then she went into the office and made an appointment shortly after. A week later she got the call saying she was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Fast Forward to 2015 when my mom was done with her treatment and was Cancer free I decided to try sewing. My mom and I found these cool bags that we should try to make and after awhile they got better and better. In January of 2016 I started to sell the bags that I made. In the beginning I sold about 10 bags from facebook. The next week I made a website. The next week I decided to give some of my profits to a charity dealing with families dealing with breast cancer . That day I contacted The Karen Wellington Foundation which helps Women Living with Breast Cancer. 10% of my proceeds go to the Karen Wellington Foundation. Moving forward I\u2019m looking for another charity to give some of my profits too. I really want to teach kids to learn that giving back is a great thing to do and that giving back can change the world. Together we can change the world at one step at a time!"

In earlier 20th century we, as a people, once adorned this town with the likes of businesses such as: Doctors offices, Law firms, restaurants, schools, grocery stores, salons/barber shops, architectural and construction firms, private small airport, many home owners and many other small business owners. These small cities held their own in a time of Jim Crow, segregation, and a strong presence of racial inequality, until the 1921 race riots chocked out a once thriving city and reduced it to ruins to the point where it\u2019s been a struggle to regain that stronghold that it once had. So it is truly an honor to be a pillar in a place as the first full scale black owned beauty supply store and to pioneer another effort to bring back opportunities again to grow our community and a people who so much need a change and just an opportunity to have a choice where they can shop and not feel unappreciated. So, if your ever in our parts stop by so we can chat and service you with an attitude of mutual respect and gratitude."

We offer Flow, Restorative, Yin Yoga, and Y12SR (the Yoga of 12-Step Recovery) as well as slower-paced, alignment-based Hatha Yoga classes. There are options for all levels of experience. The weekly schedule also includes meditation, Nia, Feldenkrais\u00ae, Zumba, and contribution-based classes. We facilitate an atmosphere of community by scheduling all weekly classes 30 minutes apart, allowing space for students to connect and get to know each other in our healing-inspired studios and tea bar lounge. Many Saturday and Sunday afternoons are graced with guest teachers and holistic-based workshops or trainings for students wishing to deepen their practice."
